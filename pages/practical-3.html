   <p>
   Front-end web development is everything involved in programming the user interface of a web application. Typically it refers to the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), 
   Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript portion of web site production as opposed to the database or server-side programming. It encompasses everything from building a 
   simple page of HTML, text to creating complex, responsive HTML 5 websites designed to be accessed via various different browsers, devices and screen sizes.
